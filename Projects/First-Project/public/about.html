<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a Software Analysis and Development student. I'm in my first year on college and I'm
  very excited to learn a lot and to become the best professional I can be in the future. In
  order to do that, I'm studying a lot about all programming languages I can handle to.
</p>

<p>I have some experience programming in C. I studied in my previous college to learn the 
  basis in programming for engineering. Although in that time, I struggled in the beggining
  when I was learning it, I really liked it to think about how to solve the problems in C.
  Now in my college, I'm learning Python and I'm studying by myself how to make web pages
  using HTML and CSS.
</p>

<p>I hope in the future I can got a job or in Web Development or in Software Development. My
  dream is to live in another country, working and living there.
