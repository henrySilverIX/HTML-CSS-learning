<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Marley and me</h3>
<p>This movie is so sad and it makes me feel sad, because it makes me rememeber my dog.</p>


<h3>The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</h3>
<p>This movie ends one of the best trilogies of all time and it's pretty epic.</p>


<h3>The Eight Hateful</h3>
<p>This is one of my favorite Tarantino's movie. The immersion this movie brings to you is immeasurable.</p>
